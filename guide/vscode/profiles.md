> [!NOTE]  
> This guide was last modified on 2024-08-18.

## Features

- Extensions already included.
- Different extensions for each profile.
- Different themes on different profiles to better fit each programming language.
- A default formatter has been set for each profile and it formats on save. The "Web development" profile also has specific formatting guidelines.

## Future features

- Different fonts on profiles to better fit the different programming languages.
- Different zoom settings for every profile.
- Custom keybinds? (Unsure as I want these to be pretty much default)

## How to use

1. Click on the icon in the bottom left in Visual Studio Code.
2. Hover over "Profile".
3. Click on "Import profile".
4. Wait for the extensions to be installed and for the settings to be applied.
5. Done!
