## Usage

### Explanation

Each guide contains detailed instructions and scripts for setting up the respective operating systems and environments. Clone this repository and navigate to the desired guide for further instructions. All guides are located in the `guide` folder and all scripts and files are located in the `install` folder. To find the guide for a certain "install" please look for a file with a similar name in the `guide` folder since all guides should be named similarly named for easier access.
